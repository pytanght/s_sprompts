Present an exquisite, miniature 3D cartoon-style scene of the user-specified subject, clearly viewed from a 45° top-down perspective.

Place the subject's most iconic representation, character, or landmark prominently at the center, complemented by proportionally-sized icons of key elements, symbolic items, charming figures, props, and other details illustrating the subject's core theme or narrative. The scene should be detailed, finely crafted, and playful.

Rendered with Cinema 4D, the modeling should be refined, smoothly rounded, and rich in texture, accurately capturing realistic PBR materials. Gentle, lifelike lighting and soft shadows should create a warm, comfortable ambiance.

Maintain a clean, minimalist layout and a solid-color background to highlight the primary content.

At the top-center of the scene, prominently display the subject name in a large font size.

All texts should be displayed in the language specified or entered by the user, without any background, and may subtly overlap with the scene elements to enhance overall design integration.
