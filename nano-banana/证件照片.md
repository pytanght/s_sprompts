---- Prompt (upload a photo and update the document type at the bottom ----

Generate an ultra-realistic personal ID photo for 【Document Type】, precisely replicating all facial features from the uploaded photograph without any beautification, editing, or alterations, strictly complying with official standards for the specified document.

Step 1: Retrieve or request the official photo guidelines based on user-selected country and 【Document Type】 (e.g., passport, ID card, visa, driver's license, student card, etc.):

- Background Color: (Default: solid white)
- Facial Position: (Default: face forward, clearly visible from the top of the head to the chin, head centered)
- Expression: (Default: neutral, natural, eyes open and directly facing the camera; exceptions for religious or medical reasons)
- Eyewear: (Default: no glasses; medically required glasses must have lenses free of reflection or obstruction)
- Accessories Restrictions: (Default: no hats, headscarves, headphones, or other accessories, unless worn for religious reasons)
- Photo Dimensions: (e.g., 2 x 2 inches; provided by the user or retrieved automatically)

Step 2: Generate the photo strictly following the specified guidelines:

The subject faces directly forward, expression calm and neutral, mouth gently closed, both ears clearly visible, and shoulders fully captured. Use professional, soft, evenly balanced front lighting from a studio setup, ensuring no harsh shadows and a natural overall tone. The background precisely matches the specified color, uniformly clean and smooth.

Composition strictly adheres to the official guidelines for the selected document type, with the head and shoulders centered and naturally proportioned.

Finally, deliver 6 identical ID photos arranged vertically in a 2x3 grid on a single 6x4-inch print-ready photo sheet. The sheet has a light grey background to facilitate easy cutting, with uniform spacing, clean layout, and high resolution, suitable for direct printing.
