[The Composition: Unified Panoramic Masterpiece]**Hyper-realistic digital art, 8k resolution, a wide cinematic panorama of **{City_Name}**.**Visual Unity:** The composition creates a single, continuous, seamless world that magically transitions through time.**The Structure:** The image uses a "**Dynamic Diagonal Phase Shift**" (slanted cuts). However, the horizon line, the main architecture (**{Landmark}**), and the **foreground surface** are perfectly continuous geometric lines that run unbroken from left to right.**[Background Layer: The City Identity]**Spanning the entire width of the sky behind the landmark is the giant, translucent, elegant text "**{CITY_NAME_UPPERCASE}**". It blends softly into the clouds/atmosphere, acting as the visual spine of the image.**[Foreground Layer: The Continuous Table of Seasons]**At the very bottom, running across the entire width, is a **continuous textured surface** (e.g., a long wooden viewing table or stone balustrade). On this single surface, four seasonal culinary sets are placed, perfectly integrated into the lighting of their respective zones.* **Zone 1 (Left - Winter):**    * *Visual:* The diagonal slice shows the landmark in cold blue tones/frost.    * *Foreground Item:* **{Food_Winter}**.    * *Typography:* Elegant vertical Chinese text on the surface: "**冬 • {Food_Name_Winter}**" | Small caption: "**{Benefit_Winter}**".* **Zone 2 (Mid-Left - Spring):**    * *Visual:* The slice transitions to blooming **{Botany_Spring}** and fresh mist.    * *Foreground Item:* **{Food_Spring}**.    * *Typography:* Elegant vertical Chinese text on the surface: "**春 • {Food_Name_Spring}**" | Small caption: "**{Benefit_Spring}**".* **Zone 3 (Mid-Right - Summer):**    * *Visual:* The slice reveals intense sunlight, lush **{Botany_Summer}**, and high contrast.    * *Foreground Item:* **{Food_Summer}**.    * *Typography:* Elegant vertical Chinese text on the surface: "**夏 • {Food_Name_Summer}**" | Small caption: "**{Benefit_Summer}**".* **Zone 4 (Right - Autumn):**    * *Visual:* The slice melts into golden hour light and **{Botany_Autumn}** foliage.    * *Foreground Item:* **{Food_Autumn}**.    * *Typography:* Elegant vertical Chinese text on the surface: "**秋 • {Food_Name_Autumn}**" | Small caption: "**{Benefit_Autumn}**".**[Technical Specs for Consistency]*** **Lighting:** The light direction is consistent (e.g., all from top-left) but changes color temperature (Cool Blue -> Soft White -> Hard White -> Warm Gold).* **Perspective:** Unified one-point perspective. The background architecture lines must connect perfectly across the diagonal cuts.* **Style:** Editorial gastronomy photography mixed with high-end landscape art. --ar 16:9 --v 6.0 --stylize 500
