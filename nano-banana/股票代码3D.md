Present an exquisite, miniature 3D cartoon-style scene of the company corresponding to the user-specified company name or stock ticker, clearly viewed from a 45° top-down perspective.

Place the company's most iconic building or campus prominently at the center, complemented by proportionally-sized icons of its key products, charming cartoon-style figures, vehicles, and other elements illustrating everyday company activities. The scene should be detailed, finely crafted, and playful.

Rendered with Cinema 4D, the modeling should be refined, smoothly rounded, and rich in texture, accurately capturing realistic PBR materials. Gentle, lifelike lighting and soft shadows should create a warm, comfortable ambiance.

Creatively integrate the company's real-time stock market data for the user-specified date (or automatically retrieved current date) into the scene, maintaining a clean, minimalist layout and a solid-color background to highlight the primary content.

At the top-center of the scene, prominently display the company name or stock ticker in a large font size, followed by the specified date in extra-small font, and the stock price range in a medium-sized font. Include clear, intuitive stock trend icons and charts.

All texts should be displayed in the language specified or entered by the user, without any background, and may subtly overlap with the scene elements to enhance overall design integration.
