Inspired by leaf-cutout art, delicately depict a bustling “Along the River During the Qingming Festival” scene through intricate hollow cutouts on a single, complete green leaf.
The composition recreates the iconic riverside city life: arched bridges, boats on the river, merchants, pedestrians, and market activity, all rendered in miniature through precise cutout silhouettes.
All elements are organically connected by thin natural veins, ensuring no isolated or floating segments.
The leaf surface has a glossy, wet appearance with tiny sparkling water droplets, enhancing texture and realism.
Soft sunlight gently illuminates the leaf, creating subtle highlights and shadows that emphasize depth and craftsmanship.
Background features a softly blurred ancient riverside city atmosphere inspired by Northern Song architecture, maintaining a calm yet lively mood.
Captured in ultra-detailed 8K resolution for macro-level realism.
Dynamic effect: gentle river flow suggested through flowing cutout lines, with drifting petals and light dust motes subtly floating through the air.
